# Contribution of Australia in Reddit's 2022 r/place event
An archive of the most 'complete' art created by Australia found throughout Reddit's 2022 r/place event. I have scowered through archives of Australia's work to recreate aspects and present them.

All Files are provided as:
- Original Images: a 1:1 of the pixels used to create it in PNG (.png) format
- Display-Size Images: larger PNG (.png) images that were exported directly to use in creating the Displays
- Original Files: a Pixilart (.pixil) file that was saved as I used Pixilart to create them (https://www.pixilart.com)
- 4k Display Images: 4k images (3840 x 2160) of the creations displayed with their informal name as PNG (.png) files
- 4k Display Files: The Illustator (.ai) file where the displays were compiled. Note: to reduce size, the Illustrator file uses linked embeds, so you will need to download the Display-Size Images and relink them on launch.
